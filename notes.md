Alright so feel like i have done the HTML part okai i guess i hope in a way hopefully still going to see
how things are going to be. Going to start with styling now but going to try and setup the styles then start
styling like a cool kid
## forth Note
Basically got a decent mobile design started so that is nice. kind of need to find a way to center it
better to be honest using **FlexBox** but seems to me might need to try and use something else tbh
Still.... i dont know for sure. but yeah going to try and setup the progress bar in preety much the bottom
section Tomorrow. 

1. Find a way to make it centered
2. Create progresBar
3. Finish the challange

Hopefully it will work out.... ⌛️🤞🏿😕
